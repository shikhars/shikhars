👋 Hi, I’m Shikhar.

👨‍💻 I specialize in creating dynamic, scalable web applications using Django. 🌐

🛠️ Passionate about building and sharing free, open-source tools. 

🔗 Adept in developing robust APIs with Django Rest Framework.

🚀 On a mission to build privacy-first technologies, I explore the intersections of AI, crypto, and data science to bring innovative solutions to life.

📚 Whether through detailed blog posts or code contributions, I'm all about sharing knowledge and helping others harness the power of technology.

Let's collaborate and create something amazing! 💡
